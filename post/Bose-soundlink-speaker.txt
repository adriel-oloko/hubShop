<p>Futuristic speakers. Two nights ago, I was about to go to bed after our night devotion (I know most normal family do morning devotion, okay let me call it night prayer). I noticed something on the chair I was sitting on that I thought was a piece of bone. Immediately the prayer was over, I picked it up with the intention of throwing it away or eating it.</p>
