<div class="markup -oxa -pas">For imaging duties, the <strong>Redmi 10C</strong> has a triple-camera setup which includes a 13MP+2MP+2MP. Backed by a 5000mAh battery. The 5MP front camera is for taking wide-angle photos.</div>

<div class="markup -oxa -pas">A normal camera lens takes a 75&deg; angle photo and the problem with that angle is that it's a small frame that is not good for group photos or scenic photos. To take wide-angle photos, you need a wide-angle camera. With a wide-angle camera, you get an angle that fits everything on the frame without you moving back to capture the whole scene.</div>
<div class="markup -oxa -pas">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="markup -oxa -pas">The <strong>camera is for taking close-ups&nbsp;</strong>of small objects. Trying to capture close-ups of small objects can be difficult using a normal camera lens. The more you move your smartphone towards the subject the more distorted the image becomes. With a macro camera, you can take clear, detailed images of up to 2.5cm of the subject without losing clarity. Do more with the Redmi 10C.</div>
